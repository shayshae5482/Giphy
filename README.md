Create a website that utilizes GIPHY API. In this project I wanted to create a website that made people have fun. What's better fun than dancing? With this app, users get to check out popular dance moves and with the magic of JQuery, dynamically add dance moves of their own. 

# Technologies Used:
* HTML5
* Bootstrap
* CSS
* Javascript
* JQuery
* AJAX
* GIPHY API
